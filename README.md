# FERNANDO SADA'S PORTFOLIO
## About the proccess
Developing my web portfolio was a valuable learning experience that required me to refine my process and overcome challenges. Initially, I faced difficulties in structuring the portfolio in a cohesive and visually appealing manner. Through research on effective portfolio designs and feedback from peers and mentors, I was able to create a clear and engaging layout. Another challenge was integrating interactive elements and animations while maintaining fast loading times. I optimized media files and implemented efficient coding practices to address this issue. This experience taught me the importance of balancing creativity with functionality and prioritizing user experience in web design. Overall, creating my web portfolio enhanced my skills as a designer and developer.

**Some things I learn in the Web Development Course:**
1. Accesibility
2. Responsive Design
3. Image Optimization
